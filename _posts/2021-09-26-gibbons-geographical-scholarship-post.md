**What points is this paper trying to explain?**

This paper explains the important interaction between geography and historical naritives. The paper goes into detail about Gibbon's aquistion of geographical knowledge. At the start is highlights the importants of both place and time when looking at historical information. The paper credits his geographic ability as a historian and scholar. It describes his consumtion of geopgrical knowledge and the essential role it played for The Decline and fall of the Roman Empire.

**Who are the people that this article mentions? Can you get background information about them online, whether from Wikipedia or elsewhere? Can you figure out what is going on?**

The people mentioned in paper include John Locke, Homer, Jean-Baptiste Bourguignon d’Anville, and Abu al Fida. All of these people have a variety of information available online. John Locke was only slightly before Gibbon's time and highlighted the need of geographical understanding in regards to narrtitive over time. Additionally, he believed geography could most easily be learn through maps and globes. Homer is a famous greek aurthor. His most noteable works are the Iliad and the Odyssey. He is an estemed figure in greek literature. Both d'Anville and Abu al Fida are geographers who Gibbon drew a lot of inspiration from. Jean-Baptiste Bourguignon d’Anville was also a cartographer for the king of France and greatly improved the trade of map making. Similarly Abu al Fida was a famous Kurish historian and geographer. There is an extensive amount of information about all these people online because all were/are famous for their work.

**What might WE do to accomplish this goal better?**

We have technology and means of analysis. I feel the simpliest form to improve historical analysis and geography would be an interactive map. It can show the story, add time dimension, and show everything visually. The problem is how to get the information to a level of interactibility effectively. The first step to accomplish this goal better is getting the data, input before output.

**How might we more generally convey the way Gibbon talks about space? Do we care? If so, what would be helpful?**

We should definitely care about the way gibbon speak about space. It's an essential aspect of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. If our goal is to convey the story in a more digestable way it is certainly something that needs to be translated.
